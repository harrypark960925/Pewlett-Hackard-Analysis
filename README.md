# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## 1. Overview of the analysis 
Since there are too many people are reaching their retirement age at once, we need to prepare for the 'silver tsunami'. To prepare for the 'silver tsunami', we need to determine the number of retiring employees per title and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. 

## 2. Results 

1. Determining the number of retiring employers per title: By using 'distinct on' clause, emplopyees who have left the company already have been excluded and only current employees are remained who are about to retire with the birth date between 1952 and 1955.
